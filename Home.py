### Understanding Meaning Blocks and Reconstruction

**Meaning Blocks:**
- Meaning blocks are the core ideas or phrases in a text that carry significant information.
- Breaking down a text into meaning blocks helps you understand its structure and key points.
- Example: In the sentence "The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his little home," you might identify meaning blocks by asking:
  - Who is doing what?
  - When is it happening?
  - What specific action is being performed?

**Reconstruction of Meaning:**
- Reconstruction involves explaining each meaning block in your own words.
- This process helps you internalize the text's nuances and improve your comprehension.
- When reconstructing, consider:
  - What is the main action or event?
  - Who is involved?
  - When does it happen?
  - Why or how is it happening?

Try your hand at identifying meaning blocks and reconstructing their meaning using the practice text below.
