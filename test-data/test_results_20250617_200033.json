Let me explain the Essay Engineering method.\n\nWe'll work with this sentence:\n\"There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked.\"\n\nLet's begin with Step 1: Break it into meaning blocks.\n\nCan you tell me:\n1. How many different meaning blocks do you think there are in this sentence?\n2. Where would you put the parentheses to separate them?\n\nJust give me your division into meaning blocks first. Once we confirm that, we'll move on to version 1 (v1) of your meaning reconstruction."

      "response": "Thanks \u2014 that's a good start. Let's refine the division based on the core principle of the Essay Engineering method: semantic grouping \u2014 what ideas belong together in terms of meaning.\n\nHere's how we can analyze it:\n\nOriginal Sentence:\n\"There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked.\"\n\nLet's apply the main rule: when different phrases all contribute to a single general idea or action, they stay in the same meaning block.\n\nIn this case, the whole sentence expresses a single emotional quality in someone's manner of speaking or behavior. Everything supports the central idea of this emotional tone.\n\nCorrect Meaning Block:\n(There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked.)\n\nNow that we've locked in the meaning block, you're ready to write version 1 (v1) of your meaning reconstruction \u2014 just remember:\n\nDon't repeat any words from the original sentence (except names of people or places).\n\nIt's fine if it's not perfect \u2014 just aim to capture some part of the meaning in your own words.\n\nGo ahead and give me your v1!"

      "response": "Your reconstruction is about 20% accurate. You're on the right track, but try to capture more of the original meaning. Remember, we're talking about a subtle emotional quality in someone's behavior, not about dogs or boys. Try your v2!"

      "step": "second_reconstruction",
      "input": "v2: it even gave a major siren sound, and for women he hated",
      "response": "Your reconstruction is about 30% accurate. Good effort! You're getting closer to the core meaning. The 'siren sound' is too dramatic - we're looking for a more subtle emotional quality. And remember, it's about people he liked, not hated. Try your v3!"
